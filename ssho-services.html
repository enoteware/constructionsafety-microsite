    <!-- What is an SSHO -->
    <section class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>What is a Site Safety and Health Officer?</h2>
            <p>A Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) is a dedicated safety professional required on federal construction projects to ensure compliance with EM 385-1-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual. The SSHO serves as the contractor's primary safety representative, responsible for implementing the Accident Prevention Plan (APP), conducting daily safety inspections, managing Activity Hazard Analyses (AHA), providing worker safety training, and serving as the main point of contact for government safety inspectors.</p>
            <p>On USACE, NAVFAC, and most federal construction contracts, an SSHO is mandatory when the contract value exceeds $5 million or when the contracting officer determines project hazards warrant dedicated safety oversight. The SSHO must be on-site at all times when construction work is being performed and cannot simultaneously serve as the project superintendent or quality control manager.</p>
            <p>Federal contracts require SSHOs to meet specific qualification levels based on project complexity and hazards. Our team includes Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 SSHOs with the training, experience, and certifications required for projects of all sizes and complexity levels.</p>

            <h2>SSHO Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q1: When is an SSHO required on federal construction projects?</h3>
                <p>A: USACE, NAVFAC, and most federal agencies require a dedicated SSHO when the construction contract value exceeds $5 million or when the contracting officer determines project hazards warrant an SSHO. Review your contract's Section 01 35 26 (Governmental Safety Requirements) for specific SSHO requirements on your project.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q2: What are the different SSHO qualification levels?</h3>
                <p>A: EM 385-1-1 defines three SSHO competency levels. Level 1 SSHOs (5+ years experience, 40-hour EM 385-1-1 training) are suitable for small, non-hazardous projects. Level 2 SSHOs (8+ years, plus additional training/certifications) handle minor construction and moderate-hazard projects. Level 3 SSHOs (10+ years, professional certifications like CSP or CIH) are required for major construction, high-hazard projects, or contracts over $35 million. Our team includes Level 2 and Level 3 SSHOs.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q3: How does working with an SDVOSB SSHO provider help my company?</h3>
                <p>A: Subcontracting SSHO services with our SDVOSB company counts toward your small business participation goals on federal contracts. This helps you meet SDVOSB subcontracting requirements, improves your past performance evaluations, and enhances your competitive position for future federal opportunities. Prime contractors must report small business subcontracting achievements, and partnering with us demonstrates your commitment to federal small business goals.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q4: Can your SSHO start immediately after contract award?</h3>
                <p>A: Our typical mobilization timeline is 1-2 weeks after contract award. The primary factor affecting start time is base access clearance—most military installations require background checks and security clearances before personnel can enter. We begin the access process immediately upon notice to proceed and work closely with base security offices to expedite clearances. For projects not requiring base access, we can often mobilize within days.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q5: Do you provide SSHO services for projects outside California?</h3>
                <p>A: Yes. While we're based in San Diego and have extensive California military installation experience, we provide SSHO services nationwide for federal construction projects. Our network includes qualified SSHOs throughout the United States who can support projects at military installations, VA facilities, and other federal construction sites nationwide.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Q6: What's included in your SSHO service pricing?</h3>
                <p>A: Our SSHO services are typically priced as a daily or monthly rate that includes the SSHO's time on-site, preparation and documentation, APP and AHA development and management, safety meeting facilitation, incident investigation, and all required reporting. We provide transparent, competitive pricing and can structure agreements as time-and-materials, fixed monthly rates, or project duration contracts depending on your preference.</p>
